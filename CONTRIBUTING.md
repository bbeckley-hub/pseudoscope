## Code of Conduct

This project adheres to a [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior to brownbeckley94@gmail.com.

## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs
If you find a bug, please create an issue with:
- **Clear title** describing the problem
- **Steps to reproduce** with example commands
- **Expected vs actual behavior**
- **Environment details**: OS, PseudoScope version, Conda version
- **Error logs** or screenshots

Before submitting, please check if the issue already exists.

### Suggesting Features
We're always looking to improve PseudoScope. Feature suggestions should include:
- **Clear description** of the feature
- **Use case** - why it would be valuable (e.g., new typing schemes, carbapenemase detection, biofilm‑related genes)
- **Potential implementation** ideas (if you have any)
- **Alternative solutions** you've considered

### Contributing Code

#### Development Setup

1. **Fork and clone the repository:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/pseudoscope.git
cd pseudoscope
```

2. **Set up the development environment:**
```bash
# Using Conda (recommended)
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate pseudoscope
pip install -e .
```

3. **Install additional databases (for testing):**
```bash
# AMR database (if using AMRFinderPlus)
pseudoscope --update-amr-db

# ABRicate databases (if using ABRicate for virulence/plasmid screening)
abricate --setupdb
```

#### Coding Style

- Follow **PEP 8** for Python code
- Use **meaningful variable names**
- Add **docstrings** to functions and classes
- Keep functions **modular and focused** on single tasks
- Add **comments** for complex logic
- Use **type hints** where possible

Example:
```python
def process_sample(sample_path: str, output_dir: str, threads: int = 4) -> dict:
    """
    Process a single P. aeruginosa genome through all PseudoScope modules.
    
    Args:
        sample_path: Path to the input FASTA file
        output_dir: Directory to write results
        threads: Number of CPU threads to use
    
    Returns:
        Dictionary containing all analysis results
    """
    # Implementation here
```

#### Commit Messages

Use clear, descriptive commit messages:
- **Good:** `Add O-antigen serotyping module for P. aeruginosa`
- **Good:** `Fix carbapenemase detection false positives`
- **Avoid:** `Update code` or `Fix bug`

#### Testing

Before submitting, ensure your changes:
- Don't break existing functionality
- Include tests if adding new features
- Pass all existing tests

## Pull Request Process

1. **Create a feature branch:**
```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

2. **Make your changes** and commit them with clear messages.

3. **Push to your fork:**
```bash
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

4. **Open a Pull Request** against the `main` branch.

5. **PR Description should include:**
   - What the changes do
   - Why they're needed
   - Any breaking changes
   - Screenshots for UI changes (if applicable)

6. **Review Process:**
   - Maintainers will review your PR
   - Address any feedback or questions
   - PR will be merged once approved
